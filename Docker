Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment and management of applications within lightweight, isolated containers. 
Containers provide a consistent and portable environment for running applications, encapsulating dependencies and allowing applications to run reliably across different computing environments. 
Docker simplifies the process of building, distributing, and running applications, making it easier to create scalable and deployable software solutions.
