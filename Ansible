Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies the management and configuration of computer systems and network devices. 
It uses declarative language to describe the desired state of systems and uses SSH or other remote management protocols to communicate and execute tasks on target machines. 
Ansible allows users to automate complex IT tasks, such as configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and cloud provisioning, making it popular among system administrators and DevOps teams.


I have writtten some blogs explaining the component. You can check the below link:
