Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 
It provides a robust framework for running and coordinating container instances across a cluster of machines. 
Kubernetes allows users to define the desired state of their applications, handles scaling and self-healing, and provides features for load balancing, service discovery, and storage orchestration, making it a powerful tool for managing containerized workloads in production environments.
