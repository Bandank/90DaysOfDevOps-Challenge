Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates the continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) of software applications. 
It provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying applications automatically, allowing developers to integrate code changes frequently and detect issues early in the development cycle. 
Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins and integrations with other tools, making it highly customizable and adaptable to different development workflows and environments.
